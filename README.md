The game controls with WASD/arrow keys and the spacebar/W/Up arrow for jump. The goal is to interact with objects in the hubworld to enter platforming levels and complete them in order to grab a gem. 
Portal objects are indicated with a floating gem above their sprite to let you know there is a level to complete
The game is currently a work in progress and still needs an end goal and more interactive systems

There is health in the game, but currently the only sources of damage are spike traps that instakill you, I will add other forms of damage and a way to heal at a later time
